# Image Manipulation through Fourier &amp; Spatial Domains

This project demonstrates key concepts of **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** through hands-on **image processing** in both the **spatial domain** and the **frequency domain**. It integrates classical DSP techniques with creative image transformations to highlight the practical power of convolution, Fourier analysis, and digital filters.
